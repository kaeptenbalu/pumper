# Binance Telegram Pump Bot

## Overview
**Please note that this bot is not intended for production use and should be used with caution.**


This is a fun project designed to automate the process of participating in cryptocurrency pump groups on Telegram. The bot will monitor messages from a specified pump group and execute trades on Binance based on the messages it receives. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3** installed on your machine.
2. **tforwarder app** installed on your smartphone to forward messages from the pump group to the bot.
3. A **Binance API token**. You can create one by following the instructions [here](https://www.binance.com/en-NG/support/faq/360002502072).
4. A Telegram bot created. You can follow the guide [here](https://statisquo.de/2020/08/21/telegram-bot-bauen-in-10-minuten-mit-python/).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Binance API Token:**
   - Go to the Binance API management page and create a new API key.
   - Save your API token and secret in a text file named `binance_credentials.txt`.

2. **Create Telegram Bot:**
   - Create a new bot using BotFather on Telegram.
   - Save your bot token in a text file named `token.txt`.

3. **Install tforwarder:**
   - Download and install the tforwarder app on your smartphone.
   - Set it up to forward messages from the pump group to your Telegram bot.

4. **Configure the Pump Script:**
   - Open the `pump3000.py` script.
   - Change line 75 to adjust the percentage of BTC to pump (default is set to 10% or 0.1).

## Running the Bot

1. Start the bot a few minutes before the scheduled pump.
2. Ensure that the bot is only allowed to send messages to itself.
3. Run the `pump3000.py` script.

### Important Notes

- The bot will only act on messages that start with `#`. Ensure that the pump group follows this format.
- Use this bot at your own risk. Cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk, and you should only trade with money you can afford to lose.
